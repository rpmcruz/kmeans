# kmeans
Java visualization of the [kmeans algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

This is only a toy for educational purposes.

By default, the interface allows to artifically creating Gaussian blobs and it gives the [Silhouette score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) for several k-means of different `k`.

It should be easy to edit to your own datasets.

To compile:

* `make`

To run:

* `java Kmeans`

It runs in a window.

There is an Applet version, but Java Applets have since been deprecated.
